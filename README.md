EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis, and it is a crucial step in the data science process. EDA involves examining and visualizing data sets to understand their main characteristics, uncover patterns, detect anomalies, and generate hypotheses. The primary goal of EDA is to gain insights into the underlying structure of the data and to inform subsequent steps in the data analysis pipeline.
Summary Statistics: Calculating and examining descriptive statistics such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range to get an initial understanding of the data distribution.

Data Visualization: Creating visual representations of the data through charts, graphs, and plots to identify trends, patterns, outliers, and relationships between variables. Common visualization techniques include histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.

Data Cleaning: Identifying and addressing missing or inconsistent data, handling outliers, and ensuring that the data is in a suitable format for further analysis.

Distribution Analysis: Examining the distribution of variables to understand their shape and characteristics, which can guide the selection of appropriate statistical methods.

Correlation Analysis: Investigating the relationships between different variables to determine if there are any patterns or dependencies. This often involves calculating correlation coefficients.

Dimensionality Reduction: Exploring techniques to reduce the number of variables while preserving essential information, such as principal component analysis (PCA).
